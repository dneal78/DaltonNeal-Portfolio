# I'm Dalton Neal! Welcome to my portfolio.
My interest in technology began at a young age - I built my first computer at the age of 13 with the help of an uncle, and became interested in software development at age 16. Right now, I'm studying for a Technical Certificate in Cybersecurity at Ivy Tech Community College, with the intent to transfer into a Bachelor's program at a local university.
